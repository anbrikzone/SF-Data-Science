# Module 2
This Project is Module_2 "EDA"

The main target was to find out impact of life conditions to educational performance and my task within the target make exploratory data analysis.

1. The data was presented as csv file, which contain 30 columns and 395 rows. The data include full information with minor quantity of NaN values in some columns. The data contain target variable.

2. Steps of work:
    - Import all necessary libraries
    - Download data from file
    - Checking content of data
    - Checking rows by NaN values
    - Analyze of nominative features: replacing NaN values by mode, analyze with boxplots and test of Student
    - Analyze of numeric features: replacing NaN values by median, create chart with pairplot from seaborn, making matrix of correlation
    - Selection of features for model
    - Conclusions

3. Some questions and answers from task:
    What was your role in the team?
    - I was alone. It my personal work, but there were support from community of SkillFactory Training center
    

    What part of your work did you find particularly satisfying?
    - I spent a lot of time to find right questions for resolving this task, because in the beginning I was not understood what exactly I should do. And finding questions and answers made me more competency.


    What didn't work out the way you wanted? What else is worth working on?
    - To structure algorithm and order to create right EDA


    What interesting and useful things did you learn in this module?
    - Found out what is it EDA and how to make right conclusion by different features


    What is your main result when completing this project?
    - Right route for analyzing data, sequence for making conclusions


    What skills can you already apply in your current activity?
    - Right now - nothing


    Do you plan to further study the materials on the project topic?
    - Yes, I do. The process of analysis data is interesting and fascinating, when you can find insights, which nobody can see.
